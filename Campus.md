### My Role
Project Manager
Strengthening companies to be data-driven organizations.

### Background
We where asked to develop courses for the Combient Walenberg sphere of companies. The courses are enabeling the companies to **Become Data Driven from the inside**. The campus is highly interactive and participants work hands on with their company data. The participants get to work on a company specific use case with the help and guidence from our mentors. 

### Course Content
#### Tools
Covering Introduction to our inhouse Jupyter Notebook hub called CodeHub. Introduction to Python, Numpy, Matplotlib & Pandas
#### Introduction to Data Science & Inspirational Use Case
What is Data Science, Overiwiev of Data Science Landscape. Data cleaning, CRISP-DM Model
#### Supervised Learning
Examples of supervised learning, Regression, Cost functions, Classification, Accuracy/Precision/Recall, Decision Tree
#### Measuring Model Performance
Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R^2, Mean Absolute Error, Anomaly detection, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC/AUCROC, F1-metric, Model selection, Cross validation 
#### Applying DS in Practice
Bias, Variance tradeoff, Overfitting, Feature Selection, Regularization, Feature Scaling, Feature Encoding, Data Exploration, Heatmap exploration
#### Unsupervised Learning
KMeans clustering, The elbow method, Dimensionality reduction, PCA, Feature reduction
#### Models for Learning
Decision Tree based: Random Forests, XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosted trees), K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm, Neural Networks, Unsupervised learning: Clustering algorithms, Gaussian Mixture, Hierarchical Clustering
#### Hypothesis Testing
A/B testing, RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial), Hypothesis testing outline, Confidence intervals when performing hypothesis testing, Fishers exact test, central limit theorem. Using p-values, Thompson sampling method

#### Final Use Case Work Covers
Use Case Matrix: Document where participants record key information about their project and chosen approach
Project Plan: Timeline of the project
Final Presentation: The participants has around 15 min to present their findings
