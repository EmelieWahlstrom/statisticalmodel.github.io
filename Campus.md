### Background
We were asked to develop courses for the Combient Walenberg companies. The courses are enabling the companies to **_Strengthening companies to be Data Driven from the inside_**. The campus is a highly interactive course where participants work hands on with their company data. The participants get to work on a company specific use case with the help and guidance from our mentors. The course is given online on our course platform and have participants from all over the world. The course contains: instruction videos, self study literature, knowledge assessment quiz, reflections on how to apply this to your job and weekly assignments. On top of this there are weekly live lectures and mentor meetings. The use cases the participants are working on are real use cases from their company. The goal is to Strengthening companies to be data-driven organizations
